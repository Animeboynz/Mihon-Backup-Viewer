# Contributing to Mihon Backup Viewer

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Make necessary changes.
3. Add code comments.
4. Use Prettier for formatting using the following config file `.prettierrc.yaml`.
   4.1 Either [integrate with your editor](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors) or `npm install` to use the pre-commit hook
5. Create that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU GPLv2 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU GPLv2](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/animeboynz/mihon-backup-viewer/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Animeboynz/Mihon-Backup-Viewer/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- Image if it relates to UI
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
