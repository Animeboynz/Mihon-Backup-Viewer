      "description": "Shizuka is a very beautiful oujo, respected daughter of the Nishizono household. Her father's company is having a slightly rough time financially and as is usual in the higher circles, her dad is trying to solve everything by having Shizuka marrying a prominent talent or a heir of a big family in order to expand & solidify the business.... Shizuka is very respectful and loves her father a lot... but she absolutely hates having her freedom restricted, however her own father pushiness has created the habit of forcing her to run away from the house every time an omai looks too imminent. Sadly for her, right now her father is totally obsessed with Kannazuki Koichi, whose talent has pushed him to become the CEO of his family corporation even though he is still attending college. Shizuka can't help but slightly flinch to herself every time her father starts praising Koichi's abilities as if he was selling a product. Predictably, Koichi is not anywhere near close to the star image that's portrayed officially and it's disclosed to the readers that he is the type that doesn't care about anyone nor anything but self-gain, and that he sees Shizuka as a hollow prize that will make him incredibly rich and will be discarded once he has had his way with it. To complete the picture, we have Tooru; a servant to the Nishizono household that is always around Shizuka and is usually at the wrong end of her outbursts, as such his job mainly consists of \"making Shizuka's wishes come true\", ergo securing places for Shizuka to run away in whenever she feels the need to and seeing to her every need. Thus, Shizuka once again runs away from home. She understands that this time will be different from the other non serious attempts, now \"she doesn't want to be found\". However little does she realize how different this time will be from all others. On one side we have Koichi, who will never let such a big chance for quick fortune slip past; on the other side we have Tooru standing always next to her, taking care of her and displaying loyalty to her is suddenly starting to bring forward conflicting feelings on our dear oujo.\n\nAlternative Name: \u304a\u5b22\u69d8\u306f\u9003\u3052\u51fa\u3057\u305f ; The daughter of the household has escaped ; The grace escape",

      "description": "When Suzuki Oji enrolled into high-school, he was hoping some kind of excitement would fall into his life -- but he never expected it to take the form of Kuromori Kisaki, a descendant from a 400-year-old clan of witches! However, Kuromori needs a special brooch in order to fly on her broom, something she lost when she landed on Suzuki after he had mistakenly thought she was falling to her death. Although he initially thinks Kuromori is being unfairly difficult to socialize with due to her \"witch\" status, he finds and returns the brooch to her. Out of gratitude, she shows her magic to him through the use of her broom. Suzuki then questions the possibility of himself flying by also wearing the brooch, but right after Kuromori pins it to his coat, both of them suddenly find themselves several feet in the air before falling into the school's swimming pool! Just who or what is Suzuki...?\n\nAlternative Name: \u9ed2\u68ee\u3055\u3093\u306f\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u304c\u4f7f\u3048\u306a\u3044 ; Kuromori-san wa Sumaho ga Tsukaenai ; Kuromori-san Can't Use a Smartphone",

Chasing after his only friend, as he attempts to locate his company, he manages to open a door to the Tower, and must face challenges at every floor of the cryptic tower. The Tower is a cryptic construction which is totally enclosed and hosts many surroundings that are exceptional. It's permeated by means of an element called \"Shinsoo\", which has unusual properties. It's inhabited by many distinct species that was intelligent. This can be due to ascension from one floor to another being merely permitted by passing challenging tests of dexterity, strength and brain. The 10 leaders and forefathers of the families are known as the 10 Great Warriors, guys of unbelievable power who jointly with Zahard ascended the Tower in the underside to the known top and beyond, and who happen to be kept eternally youthful thanks to the slowed-down effect of time to the larger floors. Little is known of the source of the Tower. Earliest historical records begin together with the incursion of the 10 Great Warriors as well as Zahard to their ascension as well as the Tower. Nevertheless, it's important to see that previous to their own coming, the floors that were distinct were populated with individuals indigenous to them. Likewise, 'Protectors', intelligent although grotesque creatures who created the ascension evaluations for every floor pre-date and Zahard and maybe have existed because the creation of the tower. Each floor is made up of three layers: an Inner Tower where Regulars are examined an outside Outer Tower which functions as the residential area, as well as a Middle Area, which functions as a network linking each floor. Such individuals are called \"Chosen Regulars\". The Tower is sealed from your vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. Nevertheless, from time to time, outstanding individuals, including the 10 Great Warriors, are in a position to open the doors (presumably permitted by the Tower's own will) and enter in.

To evade the hyenas that smelled the scent of his money, Kazura took refuge at an old residence that had been handed down from generation to generation in his family. When Kazura was investigating the place that would become his shelter, he stumbled on a certain room where it was possible to go into and back from another world. The culture and technology level of that world was relatively low. The protagonist sometimes brought goods, sometimes brought technological knowledge.

But for the majority of the population, they have no such powers and live by farming or running shops. Towns are developed by those with the weakest role... Villagers.

While he is talented at teaching elementary school students, he holds no love for children. He coldly contents himself with grinding through his job while training his colleague JD and being tossed about by the cruel currents of life. But one day, while teaching a fifth-grade class, one of his students hugs him close and tells him that she loves him. And a 14-year old middle-school student named Seika sees the entire thing. Seika blackmails him into giving her \"personal lessons\" at night.\n\nAlternative Name: Oshiego ni Kyouhakusareru no wa Hanzai desu ka?, Oshiego Ni Kyouhaku Sareru No Wa Hanzai Desuka?, \u6559\u3048\u5b50\u306b\u8105\u8feb\u3055\u308c\u308b\u306e\u306f\u72af\u7f6a\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f, \u88ab\u5b66\u751f\u80c1\u8feb\u7684\u4e8b\u80fd\u53eb\u72af\u7f6a\u5417\uff1f",

As expected, many countries immediately tried to send people into the other world, hoping to obtain vital resources or mystical treasures. None of them came back.\n\nAnd to be fair, Souya never expected to be one of those explorers. But here he was, accepting an offer by a shady company to get enough money to save his little sister. Launched into another world, he soon finds that his journey will be a hard one - not only have his teammates gone missing, but a majority of his food and weapons supply was destroyed in the transfer.\n\nThe only way left to go is forward. With only an AI companion to guide him, Souya ventures forth, hoping to find something worthwhile that will justify sending a rescue party to save him - if such a party comes at all.\n\nAlternative Name: \u7570\u90a6\u4eba\u3001\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u6f5c\u308b\u3002,Iyoujin, dungeon ni moguru.,Ihoujin, Dungeon ni Kuguru.,Kotokunibito Dungeon ni Moguru",
